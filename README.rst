Introduction
============

This project aims at providing a successor to the yaidom_ (and yaidom2) library that targets Scala 3, and that is simpler
to use, easier to learn, better documented (towards users), and finally offers backwards compatibility guarantees. The latter
means that it no longer exposes query API partial implementation traits as public APIs.

The good things of yaidom(2) must be preserved, like performance (especially with Saxon_ wrappers), the element-oriented
query API (instead of node-oriented), etc. Also its good support for `XML Namespaces`_ must remain.
